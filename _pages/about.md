Hello, math-nerdsðŸ‘‹. This is the official website for MPSTME Club Mathematica.

## Who are we?
We are a student-run mathematics club at (MPSTME)[https://engineering.nmims.edu/].
We plan to create a community where students can engage in research involving mathematics
and its applications, participate in national and international competitions and solve various brain teasing
puzzles. To know more about us, you can read our (blog)[https://mpstmeclubmathematica.github.io/intro] describing the various aspects of our club.
