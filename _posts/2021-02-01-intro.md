## About
The Math Club is all about bringing together students with an interest in mathematics and its
applications. We plan to create a community where students can engage in research involving mathematics
and its applications, participate in national and international competitions and solve various brain teasing
puzzles.

## Vision
Our club is a great way for students to not only learn new concepts but apply their knowledge to fun and
challenging problems. Furthermore, they will learn to view math not as a set of rules or guidelines, but
as an art.
